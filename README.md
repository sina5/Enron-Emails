A preview HTML file ("enron_mail - preview.html") is also included in the main folder. However, some Jupyter cell outputs are cleared in the HTML file for better viewing experience.

## Running the tests

After installing Jyputer notebook, using a command line, change the working directory to location of the folder enclosing "enron_mail.ipynb". Then type:

  jupyter notebook

A webpage opens in your main browser, and you can then select the notebook to preview. The main script is "enron_mail.ipynb", which includes the codes and documentation of exploring the dataset.
